# Fase-mask-Detection
### VGG 19 Architecture
add Codeadd Markdown
Face mask detection using VGG19 involves applying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to classify whether a person is wearing a face mask or not, essentially performing binary classification. While VGG19 is a commonly used model for this task, recent studies have shown that the MobileNetV2 model outperformed VGG19 in terms of accuracy and performance in face mask detection systems

The MobileNetV2 model achieved higher accuracy rates, smaller parameter size, and better feature extraction capabilities compared to VGG19. This comparison was based on precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics evaluated on the same datasets
